    <h1>What Is Cybersecurity? </h1>
    <p>Cybersecurity, also referred to as information technology security, 
        focuses on protecting computer systems, networks,
         and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. 
         In todayâ€™s interconnected world,
          cyber threats can come from various sources,
           including hackers, malicious software, and even disgruntled employees.
            The primary goal of cybersecurity is to ensure the confidentiality,
             integrity, and availability of data.</p>
